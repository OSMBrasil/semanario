## About us

* Since issue #262, Marc Gemis from Belgium has joined the German Wochennotiz team and adds news from Belgium and from the French community.

* We are also happy to announce that Ruben Lopez Mendoza from Ayacucho, Peru has joined the Spanish weeklyOSM team. Bienvenido Ruben!

## Mapping

* [OSM may continue to use Bing imagery](https://twitter.com/rbrundritt/status/616028862531530752) even after the[ takeover](http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/29/uber-acquires-part-of-bings-mapping-assets-will-absorb-around-100-microsoft-employees/#.ejebx4:A7ep) by Uber.

* SK53 asks on twitter [how to tag](https://twitter.com/SK53onOSM/status/618511741325082624) this new electricity tower design.

* Martijn van Exel [announces a Maproulette challenge](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-us/2015-July/015066.html) about missing railroad crossings in the USA.

* Mapbox published the [internal OSM mapping instructions](https://github.com/mapbox/mapping/wiki) that are used by their data team.

* Yandex (a Russian search engine with a map portal) now offers a Street View service. The images (not the map and aerial photographs) [may be used for mapping](http://shtosm.ru/2011/04/22/2/). (automatic[ translation](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=de&sl=ru&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fshtosm.ru%2F2011%2F04%2F22%2F2%2F&sandbox=1))

* OpenHistoricalMap [builds ](http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.de/2015/07/open-history-mapping.html)maps on its own infrastructure using OSM tools. (via [@GuerrillaCarto](https://twitter.com/GuerrillaCarto/status/622052359816941568))

* On GitHub it has been possible for some time to represent a GeoJSON file via an OSM Layer ([example](https://github.com/MaptimeSEA/geojson/blob/master/bicycle_parking_osm.geojson)). Now a link to the MapBox ["Improve this map" feature](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/improve-this-map/) has been added to help resolve (via iD or OSM Notes) any map errors.

* On the [talk-fr list](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-fr/2015-July/077356.html) there has been a discussion about the border between France and Italy in the Mont Blanc area. This was followed by a discussion on the tagging list about how to map [border disputes](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2015-July/025676.html).

* Marc Zoutendijk [explains](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/marczoutendijk/diary/35455) how you can find strange tagged POIs with the [OpenPOIMap](http://openpoimap.org). To do this click in the top right corner of OpenPOIMap "User POIs" and use a query e.g. amenity=shop.

* In a twelve-part series, Tlatet [analysed](http://tlatet.blogspot.be/2015/07/osm-retail-survey-part-1.html) the quality of POIs in OSM (specifically retail in England).

* Andreas Weber and Dennis Nienhüser (FZI Karlsruhe) have created a system for use with a Segway that recognises traffic signs so that they can be uploaded it to OSM ([Video)](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2zbipu).

## Community

* User escada is the[ belgian mapper of the month](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/escada/diary/35332) of July.

* Chris Rodier introduces its new [treelike visualization](http://threefiftythree.com/openstreetmap-a-collapsible-tree-visualisation-aka-v3/) of the OSM World. (via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leponot/status/617782933760442368))

* edward17 reported by the [Ukrainian weekly task no. 18](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/edward17/diary/35394) (building mapping with the HOT-Task Manager) (automatic [translation](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=de&sl=ru&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.openstreetmap.org%2Fuser%2Fedward17%2Fdiary%2F35435))

* [Alex](http://hdyc.neis-one.org/?rurseekatze) and [Michael](http://hdyc.neis-one.org/?Nakaner) (two students) are spending their holidays traveling across East Germany [to map the railway infrastructure there](http://blog.openrailwaymap.org/?lang=de#27) (automatic [translation](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.openrailwaymap.org%2F%3Flang%3Dde%2327&edit-text=)). See [the aims of their project](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/de/map/reiseplane-deutschlandpass-2015_46757#8/51.667/13.870).

* Esri's on the "vector tile" bandwagon too - they've presented their [Vector Basemap](http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2015/07/20/vector-tiles-preview/) at the Esri International User Conference, that follows the open Vector Tile Specification.

* After some [criticism](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/lxbarth/diary/21847#comment26563) last year, Mapbox improved the default attribution on their customer maps. Harry Wood asks if there's been any further progress. (via. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harry_wood/status/623777445527879680))

* Jochen Topf [writes](http://blog.jochentopf.com/2015-07-22-node-location-anomaly.html) about abnormalities in the decimal places of coordinates of new OSM objects.

* Mapillary discusses how their traffic sign recognition is based on a [trainable algorithm](http://blog.mapillary.com/update/2015/07/23/traffic-sign-feedback-matters.html) and user feedback (to label a road sign as right or wrong), which improves the classification accuracy.

* Three [Step-by-Step-Guides](http://canadiangis.com/openstreetmap-step-by-step-user-guides.php) help to access the OSM World.

* The mapper's "uniform" is now available [in Portuguese as well](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/leodobrasil/diary/35442).

## Imports

* Stephen Dawkins [suggests importing bus stops in some areas](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/imports/2015-July/003968.html) from the latest [NAPTAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaPTAN) dataset.

* In Austria people are [discussing whether to import](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-at/2015-July/007798.html) the tree register of the [city of Linz ](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/25181326#map=16/48.3050/14.2875)into OpenStreetMap.

* On July 20 the first public [OSMF board meeting ](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/osmf-talk/2015-July/003350.html)was held. The minutes and an audio recording of the meeting will follow soon.

## Humanitarian OSM

* HOT would like to [publish a quarterly newsletter](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/hot/2015-July/009659.html) to improve the communication within the project and is looking for help.

* A request for ["OSM Damage Assessment"](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/hot/2015-July/009653.html) shows that a lot of the OSM universe is still uncharted territory for researchers. ;-)

* A new [microtasking platform](http://crowdmap.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/app/missing_maps_follow_up/) has emerged at the University of Heidelberg. Currently human settlements and roads in [South Kivu](http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/193100#map=4/0.44/29.00) in the DRC are being checked for the [Missing Maps Project](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Missing_Maps_Project).
