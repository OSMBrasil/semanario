*O OpenStreetMap cresce muito a cada dia e precisa de servidores maiores - veja a campanha 2015 de atualização dos servidores do OpenStreetMap*. [[1]](#link-para-secao-da-campanha)

## Campanha de arrecadação para novo hardware de servidores

* Já faz uma semana que está acontecendo a [campanha de arrecadação para atualização de servidores do OpenStreetMap][campanha]. <del>Até o momento, apenas quatro quintos do total necessário de 56 mil libras foram alcançados.</del> **A meta já foi alcançada, mas ainda é possível [doar][campanha].** As maiores contribuições únicas até agora vieram da [Mapbox] e da [Mapzen], sendo que cada empresa doou 20 mil dólares, equivalente a 63,3 mil reais.

[Mapzen]: www.mapzen.com

## Mapping

* Joost Schouppe reports about [power editing](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/joost%20schouppe/diary/35194) with Level0 editor and Overpass turbo.

* Frederik Ramm [launched](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2015-June/073264.html) an escalating discussion on the pros and cons of armchair mapping, particularly in connection with HOT / Missing Maps.

* Richard Welty [suggests](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2015-June/073253.html) the tag README=* should be used to display a warning if an object carries this tag. README=* should contain a warning if the aerial photos are outdated locally (eg new buildings, demolished buildings).

## Community

* Frederik Ramm [asks](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2015-June/073251.html) who else has received "research project" mail about a "VGI in land administration" project.

* Pascal Neis' side of [changeset discussions](http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-discussions#2/33.0/-33.8) can now filter by country ([see his tweet](https://twitter.com/pascal_n/status/610182326824341504)).

## Imports

* According to Pavel Kwiecien, the import of [Czech land use information](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-cz/2015-June/011971.html) has been completed. ([see his OSM diary](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/xkomczax/diary/35230))

* Robert Buchholz [asks](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/imports/2015-June/003944.html) on the import list whether his use agreement for the OpenStreetMap community is sufficient. He would like to import 3D data (minimum building heights) of the city of Berlin.

## Events

* User "maning" [reports](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/maning/diary/35196) on a mapping party held in Iloilo City in May.

* The [Call for Papers](http://wherecamp.de/cfp) for WhereCamp in November 2015 in Berlin runs until September 26.

* See all future events in the [OSM Event Calendar](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Current_events).

## Humanitarian OSM

* Milo van der Linden has [set up a meetbot](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/hot/2015-June/009486.html) in HOT-IRC that logs the chat at meetings.

## Maps

* Richard Fairhurst's [bicycle router](http://cycle.travel/map) on [cycle.travel](http://cycle.travel/) is now also [available for the USA](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-us/2015-June/014991.html). Due to the poor data situation rural roads with a highway=residential tag *and* a tiger:reviewed=no tag (i.e. not reviewed by a human after the TIGER import) [are avoided](http://cycle.travel/map/journey/13139) during routing.

## Software

* Simon [announced](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/SimonPoole/diary/35190) the first release candidate of Vespucci 0.9.6 (Android OSM editor). It can also [be purchased](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/SimonPoole/diary/35210) via the beta program from Google Store.

* In the last issue (#255) it was [suggested](http://www.weeklyosm.eu/archives/4134) that an Apple Watch at SotM-US in New York [was the first](https://twitter.com/OSM_Tech/status/607936023075680256) to run an OSM map.  However, [Maps.me was faster](http://blog.maps.me/2015/05/mapsme-version-for-apple-watch-how-to.html)!  (via [@ШТОСМ](https://twitter.com/shtosm/status/608906204803440640))

* QField (a QGIS-compatible GIS for Android) is now available as a [beta version](http://www.opengis.ch/2015/06/15/qfield-in-the-wild/) in the Google Play Store.

* On GitHub, there is an [R interface for Leaflet,](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) which allows an easy integration and use of maps with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) in the [programming language R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)).

* Milo Yip has published a [lecture](http://de.slideshare.net/miloyip/how-to-write-the-fastest-json-parser-writer-in-the-world-20150328) on RapidJSON, a particularly fast JSON parser.(via [@kkaefer](https://twitter.com/kkaefer/status/610106126206636033))

* Mapnik's project website [has been updated](http://mapnik.org/).

* tassia presents a draft GUI for [OpenAerialMap plugins for QGIS](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/tassia/diary/35201).

## Did you know…

* ... there's a [sandbox](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Sandbox_for_editing) that you can use for testing and playing around with the raw data from OSM? Here you can can create and delete things and try something and do all you want, without breaking anything.

## Other "geo" things

* Apple is driving around places for [Apple Maps](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/06/17/apple-maps-vehicles-england-new-orleans/) in the US, the UK and Ireland. A list of cities can be found on an [Apple web site](http://maps.apple.com/vehicles/).

* AOL's subsidiary company Mapquest's tiles will be rendered in the future at Mapbox, instead of doing it themselves. In addition, [revisions to the products](http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/09/mapquest-confirms-mapbox-partnership/) are planned (via TechCrunch, also owned by AOL). Mapbox [welcomes](https://twitter.com/Mapbox/status/608290015924383744) Mapquest on Twitter.

* Fred Johansen has created a [website](http://blog.wikimedia.de/2015/05/30/visualizing-history-with-automated-event-maps/) to visualise "history with automated event maps". It seems that the base map is one from a market companion.

* At Geohipster.com, there's an interview with [Eric Gundersen (CEO Mapbox) and Alex Barth (head of Mapbox Data Team)](http://geohipster.com/2015/06/15/eric-gundersen-alex-barth-working-in-the-open-lets-us-meet-really-cool-people/).
